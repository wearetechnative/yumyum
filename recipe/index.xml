It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much of my time. About 10 minutes in the evening and 3 minutes in the morning.
Before going to bed, I prepare the dough. First, I put water in the bread pan. Then the sourdough starter, followed by the flour, and finally the salt. The quantities may vary. Sometimes, while the bread machine is kneading, I add a bit more water or flour as needed.</description></item><item><title>Savoury tart with spinach and ham and tomato</title><link>https://wearetechnative.github.io/yumyum/recipe/savoury_tart_with_spinach_and_ham_and_tomato/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wearetechnative.github.io/yumyum/recipe/savoury_tart_with_spinach_and_ham_and_tomato/</guid><description>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. Remove the puff pastry sheets from the freezer and let them come to room temperature. Meanwhile, cut the bell pepper into cubes and finely chop the garlic. Pour a very small dash of oil into a frying pan and let the spinach wilt over a low heat. Once it has shrunk squeeze out the liquid from the spinach using, for example, a sieve. Fry the bell pepper and garlic for another minute.</description></item></channel></rss>
