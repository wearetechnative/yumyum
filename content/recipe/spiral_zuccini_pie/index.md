- Mix the quark, egg, lemon zest, half the dill, and season welli with salt and pepper. 
- Spread into the cooked pastry case.
- Stack a handful of the courgette ribbons on top of each other, then start to roll into a pinwheel continually adding lengths. 
- Position this into thecentre of the pasty case, on top of the quark mix, and, holding it in position with one hand, keep adding new outer layers to the wheel to create the circle. i
- Keep adding the slices until the courgette slices start to lean on the edge of the case and hold themselves in.
