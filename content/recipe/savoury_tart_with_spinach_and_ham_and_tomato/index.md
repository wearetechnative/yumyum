- Remove the puff pastry sheets from the freezer and let them come to room temperature. 
- Meanwhile, cut the bell pepper into cubes and finely chop the garlic.

- Fry the bell pepper and garlic for another minute. 
- Beat the eggs together with the cream and mix in the herbs. 
- Grease a spring form or baking dish with a little oil and then cover with the puff pastry slices.
