Preparation: Whisk the eggs in a bowl. Add the flour and whisk until you have a smooth batter. Add the soy sauce, ginger, Chinese cabbage, bean sprouts, spring onion, garlic, and carrot to the batter. Stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper. Heat a little rice oil in a frying pan. Pour half of the batter into the pan and cook the omelette on both sides until cooked through and golden brown.</description></item></channel></rss>
