Remove the puff pastry sheets from the freezer and let them come to room temperature. Meanwhile, cut the bell pepper into cubes and finely chop the garlic. Pour a very small dash of oil into a frying pan and let the spinach wilt over a low heat. Once it has shrunk squeeze out the liquid from the spinach using, for example, a sieve. Fry the bell pepper and garlic for another minute.</description></item></channel></rss>
