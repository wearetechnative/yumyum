It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much of my time. About 10 minutes in the evening and 3 minutes in the morning.
Before going to bed, I prepare the dough. First, I put water in the bread pan. Then the sourdough starter, followed by the flour, and finally the salt. The quantities may vary. Sometimes, while the bread machine is kneading, I add a bit more water or flour as needed.</description></item><item><title>Naan bread</title><link>https://wearetechnative.github.io/yumyum/recipe/naan-bread-v1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wearetechnative.github.io/yumyum/recipe/naan-bread-v1/</guid><description>This recipe is for plain naans, but don&amp;rsquo;t let that stop you from adding garlic butter!
Preparation: Place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and add 2 tablespoons of oil, yogurt, yeast, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Mix everything with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Gradually add the warm milk, mixing everything together until it forms a cohesive dough. Transfer the dough onto a clean, floured work surface.</description></item></channel></rss>
