It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much of my time. About 10 minutes in the evening and 3 minutes in the morning.
Before going to bed, I prepare the dough. First, I put water in the bread pan. Then the sourdough starter, followed by the flour, and finally the salt. The quantities may vary. Sometimes, while the bread machine is kneading, I add a bit more water or flour as needed.</description></item></channel></rss>
