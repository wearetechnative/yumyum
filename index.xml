It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much of my time. About 10 minutes in the evening and 3 minutes in the morning.
Before going to bed, I prepare the dough. First, I put water in the bread pan. Then the sourdough starter, followed by the flour, and finally the salt. The quantities may vary. Sometimes, while the bread machine is kneading, I add a bit more water or flour as needed.</description></item><item><title>Indian vegan Curry with Naan v1.0</title><link>https://wearetechnative.github.io/yumyum/recipe/indian-curry-naan-v1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wearetechnative.github.io/yumyum/recipe/indian-curry-naan-v1/</guid><description>1 Was de komkommer, halveer in de lengte en verwijder de zaadlijsten met een theelepel.
