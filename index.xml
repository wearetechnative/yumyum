Healthy and vegan, it makes a tasty light lunch or supper.
Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Slice the cauliflower into two 1-inch steaks ‚Äì use the middle part as it‚Äôs larger, and save the rest for another time. Rub the paprika and 1‚ÅÑ2 tbsp oil over the steaks and season.</description></item></channel></rss>
